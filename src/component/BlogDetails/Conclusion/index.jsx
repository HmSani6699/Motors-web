        Automotive design has come a long way from the rudimentary models of the
        early 20th century to the high-tech, environmentally-conscious vehicles
        of today. As we look to the future, car design will continue to evolve,
        driven by new technologies and changing consumer demands. Whether it's
        autonomous driving, electric powertrains, or sustainable materials, the
        next chapter in automotive design promises to be just as exciting as the
        last.
